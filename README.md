# Auth0 Profile Manager (BETA)

This is a proof-of-concept for a potential feature of the Login by Auth0 plugin. This plugin looks for a connection to Auth0 and, if none is found, allows users to login to Auth0 and make that connection. For users with a connection already, it will display their stored user profile, if being viewed by and admin, or just their user ID if not.

This is currently in BETA and should not be installed on a production site until tested first.
